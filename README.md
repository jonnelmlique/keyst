## üîê Security Features Deep Dive

### Cryptographic Security
- **CSPRNG**: Uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographically secure randomness
- **Entropy Calculation**: Accurately measures password strength using Shannon entropy
- **Pattern Detection**: Advanced algorithms to detect and prevent weak patterns
- **Character Distribution**: Ensures optimal distribution across character sets

### Privacy Protection
- **Zero Data Collection**: No passwords, settings, or user data is ever stored
- **Client-Side Processing**: All operations happen in your browser
- **No Analytics**: No tracking, cookies, or user behavior monitoring
- **Transparent Source**: Open source with auditable security practices

### Breach Detection
- **HaveIBeenPwned Integration**: Real-time checking against 10+ billion compromised passwords
- **K-Anonymity**: Only partial password hashes are transmitted for privacy
- **Instant Feedback**: Immediate breach status with detailed information
- **Historical Context**: Shows breach count and severity

## üéØ Usage Examples

### Basic Password Generation
1. Open Keyst in your browser
2. Adjust length and character options
3. Click "Generate New Password" or press Ctrl/Cmd + G
4. Copy with the button or press Ctrl/Cmd + C

### Advanced Security Mode
1. Enable "Extended Symbols" for maximum character variety
2. Turn on "Avoid Sequential Patterns" to prevent predictable sequences
3. Use "Ensure High Complexity" for guaranteed strong distribution
4. Enable "Exclude Ambiguous Characters" for better readability

### Security Analysis
1. Generate a password with your preferred settings
2. Click on the security audit panel to expand detailed analysis
